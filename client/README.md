# ICD10.ninja - Client

The frontend interface to our model. Here's what you can do here:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm i

# Start local server
npm run start

# Build the site
npm run build

# Clean any built artifacts
npm run clean
```

You really should go one level above this repo and type `npm run start:client` 🤷‍♀️
