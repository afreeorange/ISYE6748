# ICD10.ninja - Client

The frontend interface to our model. Here's what you can do here:

```bash
# Install dependencies
yarn

# Start local server
yarn start

# Build the site
yarn build

# Clean any built artifacts
yarn clean
```

You really should go one level above this repo and type `yarn start:client` 🤷‍♀️
