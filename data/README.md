# The Data

This folder contains all the data we were provided with and all the data we generated/engineered to realize our project goals (which you can read in [our report](https://github.com/afreeorange/ISYE6748/blob/master/Final%20Report/Report.pdf)).

Data here is generated by scripts and notebooks in the `../analysis` folder. Please see `../analysis/README.md` for more information on how to regenerate the data if you'd like.

Here's what each folder contains.

## `raw`

This folder contains all the raw, untouched data and feature descriptions provided to us by our project sponsor.

## `processed`

1. An initial data exploration and feature selection.
2. ICD10 Class frequency matrices for each Layer (please read the final report or the midterm report to see what this word means in our context!)

## `layers`

Contains ICD10 Class metadata for various purposes. Used by the analysis notebooks, the frontend, and the backend.

## `similarity_matrices`

User-User and Item-Item similarity matrices. We store the similarity indices and distances. Please see `../analysis/400-similarity-matrices.ipynb` for more information.
